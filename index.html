  //HEY!!! SO if you're looking at the code, hi! I know I've joked around that this code is bad because... well, it is. 
  //Which is why I've left humorous little comments all over this file, just to get a chuckle out of my fellow coders
  //That being said, I've had a small number people actually being rude to me about this. So like. Don't?
  //I brute forced this code so it could work, and while I COULD clean it up(and may in the future but not likely),
  //I'd rather spend my time/energy adding new features or prompts then wiping off 10 lines of code or whatever.
  //So like- have fun! But please don't be rude. It works, that's what matters, lol XD
